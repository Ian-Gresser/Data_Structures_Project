# Data_Structures_Project
 Develop a program to encode a text file to Morse Code using a binary search tree that implements a map.
   ▪ Developed full program using Java for following functionalities:
      ▪ Enable user to input text file that defines a Morse Code library, allowing user to create unique
        variations and save the values to a map.
      ▪ Allows user to load more text files to encode with a binary search tree that implements a map.
   ▪ Performed error and exception handling testing.
